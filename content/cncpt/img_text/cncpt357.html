GSM has a double headed arrow pointing to a person icon labeled "GDSCTL." GSM has a double-headed arrow pointing to cylinder CAT Cloud Catalog.</p>
            <p> The Eastern Region is a vertical rectangle on the right. DB1 in the Western has a double-headed arrow labeled "GoldenGate" pointing to DB2 (RAC) in the Eastern. DB2 (Eastern) points to three small cylinders on its right labeled "Active Data Guard." DB2 has a double-headed arrow pointing down to a GSM box. A double-headed arrow is between GSM and one of the Active Data Guard cylinders. The Western and Eastern GSM boxes have a double-headed arrow between them. Below the GSM box is a CAT cylinder. The Western CAT points to the Eastern CAT and is labeled "Data Guard." Below the Eastern CAT cylinder is a DB5 (RAC) cylinder. GSM has a double-headed arrow between GSM and DB5. DB5 points toward DB7 and is labeled "Data Guard." DB4 in the Western and DB5 in the Eastern are connected by a double-headed arrow labeled "GoldenGate." DB5 points toward DB7 and is labeled "Data Guard." DB4 and DB5 are in a box labeled HR Pool. At the top of the diagram, DB4 and DB1 (Western) and DB2 and Active Data Guard databases (Eastern) are in a box labeled "Sales Pool."</p>
