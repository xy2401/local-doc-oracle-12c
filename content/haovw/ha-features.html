                  <p>Oracle Data Guard ensures high availability, data protection, and disaster recovery for enterprise data. Data Guard provides a comprehensive set of services that create, maintain, manage, and monitor one or more standby databases to enable Oracle databases to survive outages of any kind, including natural disasters and data corruptions. A Data Guard standby database is an exact replica of the production database and thus can be transparently utilized in combination with traditional backup, restoration, flashback, and cluster techniques to provide the highest possible level of data protection and data availability. Data Guard is included in Oracle Enterprise Edition.</p>
                  <p>A Data Guard configuration consists of one primary database and one or more standby databases. A primary database can be either a single-instance Oracle database or an Oracle RAC database. Similar to a primary database, a standby database can be either a single-instance Oracle database or an Oracle RAC database. Using a backup copy of the primary database, you can create up to 30 standby databases that receive redo directly from the primary database. Optionally you can use a cascaded standby to create Data Guard configurations where the primary transmits redo to a single remote destination, and that destination forwards redo to multiple standby databases. This enables a primary database to efficiently synchronize many more than 30 standby databases if desired.</p>

                     <p>Oracle Active Data Guard is an extension of basic Data Guard providing advanced features that off-load various types of processing from a production database, extend zero data loss protection over any distance, and that enhance high availability. Oracle Active Data Guard is licensed separately from Oracle Database Enterprise Edition. Oracle Active Data Guard is discussed more completely in <a href="ha-features.html#GUID-FFD1679E-2C5D-41C6-ADA5-D66D4A24FBB0">Oracle Active Data Guard</a>.

                  <p>There are several types of standby databases. Data Guard physical standby database is the MAA best practice for data protection and disaster recovery and is the most common type of standby database used. A physical standby database uses Redo Apply (an extension of Oracle media recovery) to maintain an exact, physical replica of the production database. When configured using MAA best practices, Redo Apply uses multiple Oracle-aware validation checks to prevent corruptions that can impact a primary database from impacting the standby. Other types of Data Guard standby databases include: snapshot standby (a standby open read/write for test or other purposes) and logical standby (used to reduce planned downtime). </p>

                           <p>Snapshot Standby enables a physical standby database to be open read/write for testing or any activity that requires a read/write replica of production data. A snapshot standby continues to receive but does not apply updates generated by the primary. When testing is complete, a snapshot standby is converted back into a synchronized physical standby database by first discarding the changes made during the open read/write, and then applying the redo received from the primary database. Primary data is always protected. Snapshot standby is particularly useful when used in conjunction with Oracle Real Application Testing (workload is captured at the production database for replay and subsequent performance analysis at the standby database-an exact replica of production).</p>

                              <p>Improves primary database performance: Production-offload to an Oracle Active Data Guard standby database of read-only applications, reporting, and ad hoc queries. Any application compatible with a read-only database can run on an Oracle Active Data Guard standby. Oracle also provides integration that enables the offloading of many Oracle E-Business Suite Reports, PeopleTools reporting, Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition (OBIEE), and Oracle TopLink applications to an Oracle Active Data Guard standby database.</p>
                           </li>

                              <p>Oracle Active Data Guard 12<span class="italic">c</span> provides new support for DML to global temporary tables and the use of sequences at the standby database. This significantly expands the number of read-only applications that can be off-loaded from production databases to an Oracle Active Data Guard standby database.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>The unique ability to easily scale read performance using multiple Oracle Active Data Guard standby databases, also referred to as a Reader Farm.</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>Production-offload of data extracts using Oracle Data Pump or other methods that read directly from the source database.</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>Production-offload of the performance impact from network latency in a synchronous, zero data loss configuration where primary and standby databases are separated by hundreds or thousands of miles. Oracle Active Data Guard 12<span class="italic">c</span> far sync utilizes a lightweight instance (control file and archive log files, but no recovery and no data files), deployed on a system independent of the primary database. The far sync instance is ideally located at the maximum distance from the primary system that an application can tolerate the performance impact of synchronous transport to provide optimal protection. Data Guard transmits redo synchronously to the far sync instance and far sync forwards the redo asynchronously to a remote standby database that is the ultimate failover target. If the primary database fails, the same failover command used for any Data Guard configuration, or mouse click using Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control, or automatic failover using Data Guard Fast-Start Failover executes a zero data loss failover to the remote destination. This transparently extends zero data loss protection to a remote standby database just as if it were receiving redo directly from the primary database, while avoiding the performance impact to the primary database of WAN network latency in a synchronous configuration.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>Production-offload of the overhead of servicing multiple remote standby destinations using far sync. In a far sync configuration, the primary database ships a single stream of redo to a far sync instance using synchronous or asynchronous transport. The far sync instance is able to forward redo asynchronously to as many as 29 remote destinations with zero incremental overhead on the source database.</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>Data Guard maximum availability supports the use of the <code class="codeph">NOAFFIRM</code> redo transport attribute. A standby database returns receipt acknowledgment to its primary database as soon as redo is received in memory. The standby database does not wait for the Remote File Server (RFS) to write to a standby redo log file.
                              </p>
                              <p>This feature provides increased primary database performance in Data Guard configurations using maximum availability and SYNC redo transport. Fast Sync isolates the primary database in a maximum availability configuration from any performance impact due to slow I/O at a standby database. This new FAST SYNC feature can work with a physical standby target or within a far sync configuration.</p>

                              <p>Production-offload of CPU cycles required to perform redo transport compression. Redo transport compression can be performed by the far sync instance if the Data Guard configuration is licensed for Oracle Advanced Compression. This conserves bandwidth with zero incremental overhead on the primary database. </p>

                           <li>
                              <p>Production-offload and increased backup performance by moving fast incremental backups off of the primary database and to the standby database by utilizing Oracle Active Data Guard support for RMAN block change tracking.</p>

                           <li>
                              <p>Increased high availability using Oracle Active Data Guard automatic block repair to repair block corruptions, including file header corruptions, detected at either the primary or standby, transparent to applications and users.</p>

                     <p>Data Guard standby databases can be used to reduce planned downtime by performing maintenance in a rolling fashion. Changes are implemented first at the standby database. The configuration is allowed to run with the primary at the old version and standby at the new version until there is confidence that the new version is ready for production. A Data Guard switchover is then performed, transitioning production to the new version. The only database downtime is the time required to perform the switchover.</p>
                     <p>There are several approaches to performing maintenance in a rolling fashion using a Data Guard standby. Customer requirements and preferences determine which approach is used. The following approaches are discussed in this document:</p>

                        <p>There are numerous types of maintenance tasks that are unable to use Redo Apply (physical replication) to synchronize the original version of a database with the changed or upgraded version. These tasks include:</p>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                           <li>
                              <p>Database patches or upgrades that are not Standby-First Patch Apply-eligible. This includes database patch-sets (11.2.0.2 to 11.2.0.4) and upgrade to new Oracle Database releases (11.2.0.4 to 12.1.0.1 or 12.2). </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>Maintenance must be performed that modifies the physical structure of a database that would require downtime (for example, adding partitioning to non-partitioned tables, changing Basicfile LOBs to Securefile LOBs, changing XML-CLOB to Binary XML, or altering a table to be OLTP-compressed).</p>
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>All of the previous types of maintenance can be performed in a rolling fashion using a Data Guard standby database by using Data Guard SQL Apply (logical replication) to synchronize the old and new versions of the database. Prior to Oracle Database 11<span class="italic">g</span> this required creating a logical standby database, performing the maintenance on the logical standby, resynchronizing the standby with the primary, and then switching over. Additionally if a physical standby was being used for disaster recovery, then a new physical standby database would have to be created from a backup of the production database at the new version. This represented a number of logistical and cost challenges when upgrading a multi-terabyte database.
                        </p>
                        <p>Beginning with Oracle Database 11<span class="italic">g</span>, database rolling upgrades can use a new procedure called Transient Logical that begins and ends with a physical standby database. SQL Apply is only used during the phase when Data Guard is synchronizing across old and new versions. A new logical standby database does not need to be created if there is already a physical standby in place. A new physical standby database does not need to be created from a backup of the production database at the new version after the maintenance is complete. Similar to the traditional process of upgrading a Data Guard configuration having an in-place physical standby, the original primary is upgraded or changed using redo from the new primary database and Redo Apply (a single catalog upgrade migrates both primary and standby databases to the new Oracle release). 
                        </p>
                        <p>Transient Logical upgrades require that the primary database be at Oracle Database 11<span class="italic">g</span> release 1 (11.1) or later and that the database meet the pre-requisites of SQL Apply. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Oracle provides a Bourne shell script that automates a number of the manual steps required by the Transient Logical rolling upgrade process.</p>
                        <p>Databases that use Oracle Database Vault can be upgraded to new Oracle Database releases and patch sets by using Oracle Data Guard database rolling upgrades (transient logical standby only).</p>

                  <div><span>Oracle GoldenGate is Oracle's strategic logical replication solution for data distribution and data integration.</span> Oracle GoldenGate offers a real-time, log-based change data capture and replication software platform. The software provides capture, routing, transformation, and delivery of transactional data across heterogeneous databases in real time.
                  </div>
                  <p>Unlike replication solutions from other vendors, Oracle GoldenGate is more closely integrated with Oracle Database while also providing an open, modular architecture ideal for replication across heterogeneous database management systems. This combination of attributes eliminates compromise, making Oracle GoldenGate the preferred replication solution for addressing requirements that span Oracle Database and non-Oracle Database environments.</p>
                  <p>A typical environment includes a capture, pump, and delivery process. Each of these processes can run on most of the popular operating systems and databases, including Oracle Database and non-Oracle databases. All or a portion of the data can be replicated, and the data within any of these processes can be manipulated for not only heterogeneous environments but also different database schemas, table names, or table structures. Oracle GoldenGate also supports bidirectional replication with preconfigured conflict detection and resolution handlers to aid in resolving data conflicts.</p>

                           <p>Automated remote trail file recovery by pump automatically handles when a target system is restored to a previous point in time. This feature also handles most cases where target trail files are inadvertently deleted or corrupted by automatically regenerating the missing target trail data when the source trail data is available, and by intelligently skipping any duplicate transactions when applying the change data.</p>

                           <p>If Extract is configured in a downstream deployment, where redo is shipped from the source database to be mined on the downstream database, it is possible to fetch any required data from an active standby database instead of using the source database. Fetching is done when Extract is unable to reconstruct an update operation from the redo data, or when a <code class="codeph">FETCHCOLS</code> clause is specified as part of the TABLE parameter.
                           </p>

                        <li>
                           <p>A new Extract parameter, <code class="codeph">TRANLOGOPTIONS HANDLEDLFAILOVER</code>, only permits extract from redo data that has been applied to the Oracle Data Guard standby. When an Oracle GoldenGate source database, where integrated Extract is connected, is protected by an active standby database, where there is a potential for data loss (Data Guard Maximum Performance Mode using ASYNC redo transport), it is important to ensure Extract will not extract redo data that has not yet been applied to the standby database. Doing so leads to logical data inconsistencies in the event of a data loss failover because the Oracle GoldenGate target database will contain data that is missing from the source database.

                  <div>
                     <div><span>Oracle GoldenGate logical replication enables all databases in an Oracle GoldenGate configuration, both source and target databases, to be open read-write.</span> This makes it a key component of MAA for addressing a broad range of high availability challenges for zero downtime maintenance, cross platform migration, and continuous data availability, specifically:
                     </div>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>
                           <p>Zero or near zero downtime maintenance. In this architecture, Oracle GoldenGate provides greater flexibility than the capabilities provided by Data Guard. Oracle GoldenGate source and target databases can have a different physical and logical structure, can reside on different hardware and operating system architectures, can span wide differences in Oracle Database releases (for example, 9<span class="italic">i</span> to 12<span class="italic">c</span>), or be a mix of Oracle and non-Oracle systems. This allows for the modernization of 24x7 servers and allows new Oracle features to be implemented without impacting the availability of the databases. Maintenance is first performed on a target database while production runs on the source. After the maintenance is complete, production can be moved to the source all at once, similar to a Data Guard switchover. Optionally, bidirectional replication can be used to gradually move users over to the new system to create the perception of zero downtime. In either case, Oracle GoldenGate replication can be enabled in the reverse direction to keep the original source database synchronized during a transition period, making it simple to effect a planned fall-back to the previous version if needed, with minimal downtime and no data loss.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Zero or near-zero downtime migrations when a Data Guard solution is not applicable. Platform or database migrations can be carried out using Oracle GoldenGate as the data synchronization method between the old and new systems. Once the database has been instantiated on another host, Oracle GoldenGate is configured to replicate changes from the production database. A guaranteed restore point can be created on the migrated database so that after user testing the database can be flashed back, and Oracle GoldenGate can apply any outstanding data changes from the production database before moving the application users to the new database, similar to a snapshot standby database. If desired, bi-directional replication can also be configured from the migrated database back to the production database for use as a fallback solution.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Zero or near-zero downtime application upgrades. Application upgrades that modify back-end database objects typically result in significant planned downtime while maintenance is being performed. Oracle GoldenGate replication enables data transformations that map database objects used by a previous version of an application to objects modified by the new version of an application. This enables database maintenance to be performed on a separate copy of the production database without impacting the availability of the application. After the maintenance is complete and Oracle GoldenGate has finished synchronizing old and new versions, users can be switched to the new version of the application. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Oracle GoldenGate enables read-write access to a replica database while it is being synchronized with its source database. This is most often used to offload reporting to a copy of a production database when the reporting application requires a read-write connection to database in order to function. This is also relevant to disaster recovery environments where the nature of the technology used for the application tier requires an active read-write connection to the DR database at all times in order to meet recovery time objectives.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Active-Active replication. Oracle GoldenGate supports an active-active multi-directional configuration, where there are two or more systems with identical sets of data that can be changed by application users on either system. Oracle GoldenGate replicates transactional data changes from each database to the others to keep all sets of data current.</p>

                     <p>When using Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC), Oracle GoldenGate can be configured so that it seamlessly moves between Oracle RAC nodes in the event of database instance failure or during applicable maintenance operations.</p>
                     <p>This ability provides high availability with Oracle GoldenGate and it is possible to patch and upgrade the Oracle GoldenGate software on one or more nodes in the cluster without affecting the node where Oracle GoldenGate is currently running. Then at a predetermined time, Oracle GoldenGate can be switched to one of the upgraded nodes. The switch is done without reconfiguring Oracle GoldenGate because configuration information is shared across the Oracle RAC cluster.</p>

                  </h4>
                  <div>
                     <p>Oracle Active Data Guard and Oracle GoldenGate are not mutually exclusive. The following are use cases of high availability architectures that include the simultaneous use of Oracle Active Data Guard and Oracle GoldenGate:</p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>
                           <p>An Oracle Active Data Guard standby is utilized for disaster protection and database rolling upgrades for a mission critical OLTP database. At the same time, Oracle GoldenGate is used to replicate data from the Data Guard primary database (or from the standby database using Oracle GoldenGate ALO mode) for ETL update of an enterprise data warehouse.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Oracle GoldenGate subset replication is used to create an operational data store (ODS) that extracts, transforms, and aggregates data from numerous data sources. The ODS supports mission critical application systems that generate significant revenue for the company. An Oracle Active Data Guard standby database is used to protect the ODS, providing optimal data protection and availability.    </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Oracle GoldenGate bidirectional replication is utilized to synchronize two databases separated by thousands of miles. User workload is distributed across each database based upon geography, workload, and service level using Oracle 12<span class="italic">c</span> Global Data Services (GDS). Each Oracle GoldenGate copy has its own local synchronous Data Guard standby database that enables zero data loss failover if an outage occurs. Oracle GoldenGate capture and apply processes are easily restarted on the new primary database following a failover because the primary and standby are an exact, up-to-date replica of each other.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>An Oracle Active Data Guard standby database used for disaster protection is temporarily converted into an Oracle GoldenGate target for the purpose of performing planned maintenance not supported by Data Guard. For example, a Siebel application upgrade requiring modification of back-end database objects which require comprehensive testing before switching users over to the new system.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Oracle Active Data Guard is used to protect a production environment when a major database version upgrade is required offering zero or near-zero downtime (for example, Oracle 11.2.0.3 to 12<span class="italic">c</span>.) A second primary/standby environment is created using the new database version, and Oracle GoldenGate is used to replicate data from the production environment to the copy with one-way or bidirectional replication. When Oracle GoldenGate has completed synchronizing the old and new environments, production is switched to the new environment and the old environment is decommissioned. This provides zero or minimal downtime depending upon configuration, eliminates risk by providing complete isolation between the old and new environment, and avoids any impact to data protection and availability SLAs if problems are encountered during the upgrade process.
                           </p>
                        </li>

               </h3>
               <div>
                  <p>Recovery Manager (RMAN) provides a comprehensive foundation for efficiently backing up and recovering the database. RMAN eliminates operational complexity while providing superior performance and availability of the database. </p>
                  <p>RMAN determines the most efficient method of executing the requested backup, restoration, or recovery operation and then submits these operations to the Oracle Database server for processing. RMAN and the server automatically identify modifications to the structure of the database and dynamically adjust the required operation to adapt to the changes.</p>
                  <p>RMAN is the standard interface to backup and restore from Recovery Appliance, local disk (ZFS storage), tape, and cloud object store.</p>

                  <p>Oracle RAC and Oracle Clusterware enable Oracle Database to run any packaged or custom application across a set of clustered servers. This capability provides the highest levels of availability and the most flexible scalability. If a clustered server fails, then Oracle Database continues running on the surviving servers. When more processing power is needed, you can add another server without interrupting access to data.</p>
                  <p><span class="bold">Oracle RAC</span> enables multiple instances that are linked by an interconnect to share access to an Oracle database. In an Oracle RAC environment, Oracle Database runs on two or more systems in a cluster while concurrently accessing a single shared database. The result is a single database system that spans multiple hardware systems, enabling Oracle RAC to provide high availability and redundancy during failures in the cluster. Oracle RAC accommodates all system types, from read-only data warehouse systems to update-intensive online transaction processing (OLTP) systems.
                  </p>
                  <p><span class="bold">Oracle Clusterware</span> is software that, when installed on servers running the same operating system, enables the servers to be bound together to operate as if they are one server, and manages the availability of user applications and Oracle databases. Oracle Clusterware also provides all of the features required for cluster management, including node membership, group services, global resource management, and high availability functions:
                  </p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                     <li>
                        <p>For high availability, you can place Oracle databases (single-instance or Oracle RAC databases), and user applications (Oracle and non-Oracle) under the management and protection of Oracle Clusterware so that the databases and applications restart when a process fails or so that a failover to another node occurs after a node failure.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>For cluster management, Oracle Clusterware presents multiple independent servers as if they are a single-system image or one virtual server. This single virtual server is preserved across the cluster for all management operations, enabling administrators to perform installations, configurations, backups, upgrades, and monitoring functions. Then, Oracle Clusterware automatically distributes the execution of these management functions to the appropriate nodes in the cluster.</p>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Oracle Clusterware is a requirement for using Oracle RAC. Oracle Clusterware is the only clusterware that you need for most platforms on which Oracle RAC operates. Although Oracle Database continues to support third-party clusterware products on specified platforms, using Oracle Clusterware provides these main benefits:</p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                     <li>
                        <p>Dispenses with proprietary vendor clusterware</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Uses an integrated software stack from Oracle that provides disk management with local or remote Oracle Automatic Storage Management (Oracle Flex ASM) to data management with Oracle Database and Oracle RAC</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Can be configured in large clusters, called an Oracle Flex Cluster.</p>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>In addition, Oracle Database features, such as Oracle services, use the underlying Oracle Clusterware mechanisms to provide their capabilities.</p>
                  <p>Oracle Clusterware requires two clusterware components: a voting disk to record node membership information and the Oracle Cluster Registry (OCR) to record cluster configuration information. The voting disk and the OCR must reside on shared storage. Oracle Clusterware requires that each node be connected to a private network over a private interconnect.</p>

This feature enables you to consolidate many databases into one cluster with minimal overhead, protecting them from both planned and unplanned downtime. The consolidated databases reap the high availability benefits of failover protection, online rolling patch application, and rolling upgrades for the operating system and Oracle Clusterware.
                  </p>
                  <p>Oracle RAC One Node enables better availability than cold failover for single-instance databases because of the Oracle technology called <span class="italic">online database relocation</span>, which intelligently migrates database instances and connections to other cluster nodes for high availability and load balancing. Online database relocation is performed using the Server Control Utility (SRVCTL).

               <div>
                  <p>Oracle ASM provides a vertically integrated file system and volume manager directly in the Oracle Database kernel, resulting in:</p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                     <li>
                        <p>Significantly less work to provision database storage</p>

                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>For optimal performance, Oracle ASM spreads files across all available storage. To protect against data loss, Oracle ASM extends the concept of SAME (stripe and mirror everything) and adds more flexibility because it can mirror at the database file level rather than at the entire disk level.</p>
                  <p>More important, Oracle ASM simplifies the processes of setting up mirroring, adding disks, and removing disks. Instead of managing hundreds or possibly thousands of files (as in a large data warehouse), database administrators using Oracle ASM create and administer a larger-grained object called a <span class="bold">disk group</span>. The disk group identifies the set of disks that are managed as a logical unit. Automation of file naming and placement of the underlying database files save administrators time and ensure adherence to standard best practices. 
                  </p>
                  <p>The Oracle ASM native mirroring mechanism (two-way or three-way) protects against storage failures. With Oracle ASM mirroring, you can provide an additional level of data protection with the use of failure groups. A <span class="bold">failure group</span> is a set of disks sharing a common resource (disk controller or an entire disk array) whose failure can be tolerated. After it is defined, an Oracle ASM failure group intelligently places redundant copies of the data in separate failure groups. This ensures that the data is available and transparently protected against the failure of any component in the storage subsystem.
                  </p>

                  <p>The <span class="bold">fast recovery area</span> is a unified storage location for all recovery-related files and activities in Oracle Database. After this feature is enabled, all RMAN backups, archived redo log files, control file autobackups, flashback logs, and data file copies are automatically written to a specified file system or Oracle ASM disk group, and the management of this disk space is handled by RMAN and the database server.
                  </p>
                  <p>Performing a backup to disk is faster because using the fast recovery area eliminates the bottleneck of writing to tape. More important, if database media recovery is required, then data file backups are readily available. Restoration and recovery time is reduced because you do not need to find a tape and a free tape device to restore the needed data files and archived redo log files.</p>

               <div>
                  <p>Data block corruptions can be very disruptive and challenging to repair. Corruptions can cause serious application and database downtime and data loss when encountered and worse yet it can go undetected for hours, days and even weeks leading to even longer application downtime once detected. Unfortunately, there is not one way to comprehensively prevent, detect, and repair data corruptions within the database because the source and cause of corruptions can be anywhere in memory, hardware, firmware, storage, operating system, software, or user error. Worse yet, third-party solutions that do not understand Oracle data block semantics and how Oracle changes data blocks do not prevent and detect data block corruptions well. Third party remote mirroring technologies can propagate data corruptions to the database replica (standby) leading to a double failure, data loss, and much longer downtime. Third party backup and restore solutions cannot detect corrupted backups or bad sectors until a restore or validate operation is issued, resulting in longer restore times and once again potential data loss.</p>
                  <p>Oracle MAA has a comprehensive plan to prevent, detect, and repair all forms of data block corruptions including physical block corruptions, logical block corruptions, stray writes, and lost writes. These additional safeguards provide the most comprehensive Oracle data block corruption prevention, detection, and repair solution. Details of this plan are described in the My Oracle Support note "Best Practices for Corruption Detection, Prevention, and Automatic Repair - in a Data Guard Configuration."</p>

Database administrators and the operations team can incorporate manual checks such as running RMAN backups, RMAN "check logical" validations or running the <code class="codeph">ANALYZE VALIDATE STRUCTURE</code> command on important objects. Manual checks are especially important to validate data that are rarely updated or queried. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Runtime checks are far superior in that they catch corruptions almost immediately or during runtime for actively queried and updated data. Runtime checks can prevent corruptions or automatically fix corruptions resulting in better data protection and higher application availability. A new background check has been introduced in Exadata to automatically scan and scrub disks intelligently with no application overhead and to automatically fix physically corrupted blocks.</p>

                        <p>Failure diagnosis</p>
                        <p>The first symptoms of database failure are usually error messages, alarms, trace files and dumps, and failed health checks. Assessing these symptoms can be complicated, error-prone, and time-consuming. Data Recovery Advisor automatically diagnoses data failures and informs you about them.</p>

                        <p>Even if a failure was diagnosed correctly, selecting the correct repair strategy can be error-prone and stressful. Moreover, there is often a high penalty for making poor decisions in terms of increased downtime and loss of data. Data Recovery Advisor automatically determines the best repair for a set of failures and presents it to you. </p>

               </h3>
               <div>
                  <p>State object quarantine enables the database instance to continue operating even if there are bad objects.</p>
                  <p>A state object is a session-level structure that contains metadata about the status of database resources such as processes, sessions, and transactions in the SGA. If a process or session terminates, then PMON uses the state object to release the held resources to the operating system.</p>
                  <p>In some cases, PMON can quarantine corrupted, unrecoverable state objects so that the database instance is not immediately forced to terminate. PMON continues to perform as much cleanup as possible on the quarantined object. The <code class="codeph">V$QUARANTINE</code> view contains metadata such as the type of object, amount of memory consumed, Oracle error causing the quarantine, and so on.
                  </p>
                  <p>This helps overall CDB or non-CDB database and application availability by isolating, or putting into quarantine, resources in memory so that it does not affect the rest of the database, preventing an instance or database from aborting. The impact may be limited to one session instead of the entire database and application. Accessing a corrupted memory structure in the SGA such as library cache or row cache memory objects can result in ORA-600 errors or ORA-7445 which can result in a database or instance crash. With State Object Quarantine, the session gets an error and the corrupted resource is quarantined to ensure other processes, including critical background processes, are not impacted. </p>

                  <p>The best protection against human errors is to prevent their occurrence. The best way to prevent human errors is to restrict user access to only those data and services required to perform business functions. Oracle Database provides a wide range of security tools to control access to application data by authenticating database users and then enabling administrators to grant them only those privileges required to perform their duties.</p>
                  <p>In addition, the Oracle Database security model provides the ability to restrict data access at a row level using Oracle Virtual Private Database, thereby further isolating database users from data that they do not need to access.</p>

               </h3>
               <div>
                  <p>Oracle Flashback technology is a group of Oracle Database features that let you view past states of database, database objects, transactions or rows or to rewind the database, database objects, transactions or rows to a previous state without using point-in-time media recovery.</p>
                  <p>With flashback features, you can:</p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                     <li>
                        <p>Perform queries to show data as it looked at a previous point in time</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Perform queries that return metadata that shows a detailed history of changes to the database</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Recover tables or rows to a previous point in time</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Automatically track and archive transactional data changes</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Roll back a transaction and its dependent transactions while the database remains online</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Undrop a table</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Recover a database to a point-in-time without a restore operation</p>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Other than the flashback database feature, most Oracle Flashback features use the Automatic Undo Management (AUM) system to obtain metadata and historical data for transactions. They rely on undo data, which are records of the effects of individual transactions. For example, if a user runs an UPDATE statement to change a salary from 1000 to 1100, then Oracle Database stores the value 1000 in the undo data.</p>
                  <p>Undo data is persistent and survives a database shutdown. By using flashback features, you can use undo data to query past data or recover from logical damage. Besides using it in flashback features, Oracle Database uses undo data to perform these actions:</p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                     <li>
                        <p>Roll back active transactions</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Recover terminated transactions by using database or process recovery</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Provide read consistency for SQL queries</p>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Oracle Flashback can address and rewind data that is compromised due to various human or operator errors that inadvertently or maliciously change data, cause bad installations and upgrades, and result in logical errors in applications. These problems are addressed in the following phases, and use features such as flashback transaction, flashback drop, flashback table, and flashback database.</p>
                  <p>Phase 1: Detection of logical failure, which is usually done by the application.</p>
                  <p>Phase 2: Error investigation using features such as flashback query, flashback version query, and flashback transaction query and the <code class="codeph">DBMS_FLASHBACK</code> package.
                  </p>
                  <p>Phase 3: Error recovery.</p>

                     <p>Oracle Flashback Query (Flashback Query) provides the ability to view data as it existed in the past by using the Automatic Undo Management system to obtain metadata and historical data for transactions. Undo data is persistent and survives a database malfunction or shutdown. The unique features of Flashback Query not only provide the ability to query previous versions of tables, they also provide a powerful mechanism to recover from erroneous operations.</p>
                     <p>Uses of Flashback Query include:</p>

                           <p>Recovering lost data or undoing incorrect, committed changes. For example, rows that were deleted or updated can be immediately repaired even after they were committed.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Comparing current data with the corresponding data at some time in the past. For example, by using a daily report that shows the changes in data from yesterday, it is possible to compare individual rows of table data, or find intersections or unions of sets of rows.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Checking the state of transactional data at a particular time, such as verifying the account balance on a certain day.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Simplifying application design by removing the need to store certain types of temporal data. By using Flashback Query, it is possible to retrieve past data directly from the database.</p>

                     <p>Oracle Flashback Version Query is an extension to SQL that you can use to retrieve the versions of rows in a given table that existed at a specific time interval. Oracle Flashback Version Query returns a row for each version of the row that existed in the specified time interval. For any given table, a new row version is created each time the <code class="codeph">COMMIT</code> statement is executed.
                     </p>
                     <p>Oracle Flashback Version Query is a powerful tool that database administrators (database administrators) can use to run analysis to determine the source of problems. Additionally, application developers can use Oracle Flashback Version Query to build customized applications for auditing purposes.</p>

                     <p>When an Oracle Flashback recovery operation is performed on the database, the DBA must determine the point in time—identified by the system change number (SCN) or time stamp—to which you can later flash back the data. Oracle Flashback restore points are labels that you can define to substitute for the SCN or transaction time used in Flashback Database, Flashback Table, and Oracle Recovery Manager (RMAN) operations. Furthermore, a database can be flashed back through a previous database recovery and opened with an <code class="codeph">OPEN RESETLOGS</code> command by using guaranteed restore points. Guaranteed restore points allow major database changes—such as database batch jobs, upgrades, or patches—to be quickly undone by ensuring that the undo required to rewind the database is retained.

                     <p>You can rewind a PDB to a previous SCN. The <code class="codeph">FLASHBACK PLUGGABLE DATABASE</code> command, which is available through SQL or Recovery Manager, is analogous to <code class="codeph">FLASHBACK DATABASE</code> in a non-CDB.
                     </p>
                     <p>Flashback PDB protects an individual PDB against data corruption, widespread user errors, and redo corruption. The operation does not rewind data in other PDBs in the CDB.</p>
                     <p>In releases prior to Oracle Database 12<span class="italic">c</span> Release 2 (12.2), you could create a restore point—an alias for an SCN—only when connected to the root. Now you can use <code class="codeph">CREATE RESTORE POINT ... FOR PLUGGABLE DATABASE</code> to create a PDB restore point, which is only usable within a specified PDB. As with CDB restore points, PDB restore points can be normal or guaranteed. A guaranteed restore point never ages out of the control file and must be explicitly dropped. If you connect to the root, and if you do not specify the <code class="codeph">FOR PLUGGABLE DATABASE</code> clause, then you create a CDB restore point, which is usable by all PDBs.
                     </p>
                     <p>A special type of PDB restore point is a clean restore point, which you can only create when a PDB is closed. For PDBs with shared undo, rewinding the PDB to a clean restore point is faster than other options because it does not require restoring backups or creating a temporary database instance.</p>

                     <p>After attempting to automatically repair corrupted blocks, block media recovery can optionally retrieve a more recent copy of a data block from the flashback logs to reduce recovery time. Automatic block repair allows corrupt blocks on the primary database to be automatically repaired as soon as they are detected, by using good blocks from a physical standby database. </p>
                     <p>Furthermore, a corrupted block encountered during instance recovery does not result in instance recovery failure. The block is automatically marked as corrupt and added to the RMAN corruption list in the <code class="codeph">V$DATABASE_BLOCK_CORRUPTION</code> table. You can subsequently issue the RMAN <code class="codeph">RECOVER BLOCK</code> command to fix the associated block. In addition, the RMAN <code class="codeph">RECOVER BLOCK</code> command restores blocks from a physical standby database, if it is available.

                  <div>
                     <p>Oracle Database File System (DBFS) takes advantage of the features of the database to store files, and the strengths of the database in efficiently managing relational data, to implement a standard file system interface for files stored in the database. With this interface, storing files in the database is no longer limited to programs specifically written to use BLOB and CLOB programmatic interfaces. Files in the database can now be transparently accessed using any operating system (OS) program that acts on files. For example, extract, transform, and load (ETL) tools can transparently store staging files in the database.</p>
                     <p>Oracle DBFS provides the following benefits:</p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>
                           <p>Full stack integration recovery and failover: By storing file system files in a database structure, it is possible to easily perform point-in-time recovery of both database objects and file system data.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Disaster Recovery System Return on Investment (ROI): All changes to files contained in DBFS are also logged through the Oracle database redo log stream and thus can be passed to a Data Guard physical standby database. Using Oracle Active Data Guard technology, the DBFS file system can be mounted read-only using the physical standby database as the source. Changes made on the primary are propagated to the standby database and are visible once applied to the standby.</p>

                  <div>
                     <p>Oracle ASM Cluster File System (ACFS) is a multiplatform, scalable file system, and storage management technology that extends Oracle Automatic Storage Management (Oracle ASM) functionality to support customer files maintained outside of Oracle Database. Oracle ACFS supports many database and application files, including executables, database trace files, database alert logs, application reports, BFILEs, and configuration files. Other supported files are video, audio, text, images, engineering drawings, and other general-purpose application file data.</p>
                     <p>Oracle ACFS takes advantage of the following Oracle ASM functionality:</p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Maximized performance through direct access to Oracle ASM disk group storage</p>
                        </li>

                           <p>Balanced distribution of Oracle ACFS across Oracle ASM disk group storage for increased I/O parallelism</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Data reliability through Oracle ASM mirroring protection mechanisms</p>
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>An additional feature of Oracle ACFS is Oracle ACFS Replication which, similar to Data Guard for the database, enables replication of Oracle ACFS file systems across the network to a remote site, providing disaster recovery capability for the file system. Oracle ACFS replication captures file system changes written to disk for a primary file system and records the changes in files called replication logs. These logs are transported to the site hosting the associated standby file system where background processes read the logs and apply the changes recorded in the logs to the standby file system. After the changes recorded in a replication log are successfully applied to the standby file system, the replication log is deleted from the sites hosting the primary and standby file systems.</p>
                     <p>Oracle Data Guard and Oracle ACFS can be combined to provide a full stack high availability solution with Data Guard protecting the database with a standby database and Oracle ACFS replicating the file system changes to the standby host. For planned outages the file system and the database remain consistent to a point in time with zero data loss. </p>

                  </h4>
                  <div>
                     <p>The Oracle Solaris ZFS Storage Appliance series supports snapshot-based replication of projects and shares from a source appliance to any number of target appliances manually, on a schedule, or continuously for the following use cases:</p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>
                           <p>Disaster recovery: Replication can be used to mirror an appliance for disaster recovery. In the event of a disaster that impacts the service of the primary appliance (or even an entire data center), administrators activate the service at the disaster recovery site, which takes over using the most recently replicated data. When the primary site is restored, data changed while the disaster recovery site was in service can be migrated back to the primary site, and normal service is restored. Such scenarios are fully testable before a disaster occurs.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Data distribution: Replication can be used to distribute data (such as virtual machine images or media) to remote systems across the world in situations where clients of the target appliance would not ordinarily be able to reach the source appliance directly, or such a setup would have prohibitively high latency. One example uses this scheme for local caching to improve latency of read-only data (such as documents).</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Disk-to-disk backup: Replication can be used as a backup solution for environments in which tape backups are not feasible. Tape backup might not be feasible, for example, because the available bandwidth is insufficient or because the latency for recovery is too high.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Data migration: Replication can be used to migrate data and configuration between Oracle Solaris ZFS Storage appliances when upgrading hardware or rebalancing storage. Shadow migration can also be used for this purpose.</p>
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>The architecture of Oracle Solaris ZFS Storage Appliance also makes it an ideal platform to complement Data Guard for disaster recovery of Oracle Fusion Middleware. Oracle Fusion Middleware has a number of critical files that are stored outside of the database. These binaries, configuration data, metadata, logs and so on also require data protection to ensure availability of the Oracle Fusion Middleware. For these, the built-in replication feature of the ZFS Storage Appliance is used to move this data to a remote disaster recovery site.</p>
                     <p>Benefits of the Oracle Solaris ZFS Storage Appliance when used with Oracle Fusion Middleware include:</p>

                        <li>
                           <p>Provides ability to quickly create clones and snapshots of databases to increase ROI of DR sites</p>

               </h3>
               <div>
                  <p>A highly available architecture requires the application tier to transparently fail over to a surviving instance or database advertising the required service. This ensures that applications are generally available or minimally impacted in the event of node failure, instance failure, data corruption, or database failures. Transparent client failover enables applications to fail over to another available Oracle RAC instance or to another database (such as in the case of a Data Guard role transition or Oracle GoldenGate).</p>
                  <p>Client failover encompasses failure notification, connection cleanup, automatic retries and reconnection to a database service residing in another Oracle RAC instance or database and possibly retry the database request.</p>
                  <p>At a high level, the following components are used to provide for seamless client failover:</p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                     <li>
                        <p><span class="bold">Services</span> 
                        </p>
                        <p>Oracle Database provides a powerful automatic workload management facility, called services, to enable the enterprise grid vision. Services are entities that you can define in Oracle databases that enable you to group database workloads, route work to the optimal instances that are assigned to offer the service, and achieve high availability for planned and unplanned actions.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p><span class="bold">High Availability Framework</span> 
                        </p>
                        <p>An Oracle RAC component that enables Oracle Database to maintain components in a running state.</p>

                        <p><span class="bold">Fast Application Notification (FAN)</span></p>
                        <p>FAN is a high availability notification mechanism that Oracle RAC uses to notify other processes about configuration-level and service-level information that includes service status changes, such as UP or DOWN events. FAN also provides load advisory notifications. The Oracle client drivers and Oracle connection pools respond to FAN events and take immediate action. FAN UP and DOWN events can apply to instances, services, and nodes.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p><span class="bold">Transaction Guard</span></p>
                        <p>Transaction Guard is a tool that provides a protocol and an API for at-most-once execution of transactions in case of unplanned outages and duplicate submissions.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p><span class="bold">Application Continuity</span></p>
                        <p>Application Continuity provides a general purpose infrastructure that replays the in-flight request when a recoverable error is received, masking many system, communication, and storage outages and hardware failures. Unlike other recovery technologies, this feature attempts to recover the transactional and non-transactional session states beneath the application, so that the outage appears to the application as a delayed execution.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p><span class="bold">Connection Load Balancing</span></p>
                        <p>Connection Load Balancing is a feature of Oracle Net Services that balances incoming connections across all of the instances that provide the requested database service. </p>
                        <p>With run-time connection load balancing, applications can use load balancing advisory events to provide better service to users. Oracle JDBC, Oracle Universal Connection Pool for Java, OCI session pool, ODP.NET, and Oracle WebLogic Server Active GridLink for Oracle RAC clients are automatically integrated to take advantage of load balancing advisory events. The load balancing advisory informs the client about the current service level that an instance is providing for a service</p>

                        <p>Fast Connection Failover is the ability of Oracle Clients to provide rapid failover of connections by subscribing to FAN events.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p><span class="bold">Transparent Application Failover (TAF)</span></p>
                        <p>Transparent Application Failover is a run-time failover for high availability environments that refers to the failover and re-establishment of application-to-service connections. It enables client applications to automatically reconnect to the database if the connection fails, and, optionally, resume a SELECT statement that was in progress. This reconnection happens automatically from within the Oracle Call Interface (OCI) library.</p>

                        <p>SCAN provides a single name to the clients connecting to Oracle RAC that does not change throughout the life of the cluster, even if you add or remove nodes from the cluster. Clients connecting with SCAN can use a simple connection string, such as a thin JDBC URL or EZConnect, and still achieve the load balancing and client connection failover.</p>

                        <p>Global Data Services (GDS) is a new capability of Oracle Database that extends the concept of services to a globally replicated configuration involving a combination of single-instance, Oracle RAC, Oracle Active Data Guard, and Oracle GoldenGate. This enables services to be deployed anywhere within this globally replicated configuration, supporting load balancing, high availability, database affinity, and so on.</p>

                        <p>A service name is a logical representation of a service used for client connections. When a client connects to a listener, it requests a connection to a service. When a database instance starts, it registers itself with a listener as providing one or more services by name. A single service, as known by a listener, can identify one or more database instances in an Oracle RAC or Data Guard environment.

In the event of a Data Guard failover, this service migrates to any database that currently holds the primary role.

                           <p>Resource profiles are automatically created when you define a service. A resource profile describes how Oracle Clusterware should manage the service and which instance the service should failover to if the preferred instance stops. Resource profiles also define service dependencies for the instance and the database. Due to these dependencies, if you stop a database, then the instances and services are automatically stopped in the correct order.</p>
                           <p>When you define a service for an administrator-managed database, you define which instances usually support that service using <code class="codeph">SRVCTL</code> with the <code class="codeph">-preferred</code> parameter. These are known as the preferred instances. You can also define other instances to support a service if the service's preferred instance fails using <code class="codeph">SRVCTL</code> with the <code class="codeph">-available</code> parameter. These are known as available instances.
                           </p>
                           <p>When you specify preferred instances, you are specifying the number of instances on which a service usually runs. This is the maximum cardinality of the service. Oracle Clusterware attempts to ensure that the service runs on the number of instances for which you have configured the service. Afterward, due to either instance failure or planned service relocations, a service may be running on an available instance.</p>
                           <p>If an instance fails, then you cannot control to which available instance Oracle Clusterware relocates the services if there are multiple instances in the list. During a planned operation, however, you can manually direct the service to any instance in either the preferred or the available list not currently offering the service.</p>

                           <p>If you configured Data Guard in your Oracle RAC environment, then you can define a role for each service using <code class="codeph">SRVCTL</code> with the <code class="codeph">-l</code> parameter. When you specify a role for a service, Oracle Clusterware automatically starts the service only when the database role matches the role you specified for the service. Valid roles are PRIMARY, PHYSICAL_STANDBY, LOGICAL_STANDBY, and SNAPSHOT_STANDBY and you can specify more than one role for a service.
                           </p>
                           <p>If multiple databases in the cluster offer the same service name, then Oracle RAC balances connections to that service across all such databases. This is useful for standby and active Data Guard databases, but if you want client connections to a service to be directed to a particular database, then the service name must be unique within the cluster (not offered by any other database).</p>

                        <p>With FAN, the continuous, dynamic database services built into Oracle RAC, Data Guard, and Global Data Services are extended to applications and mid-tier servers. When the state of a database service changes (for example, up, down, or not restarting), the new status is posted to interested subscribers through FAN events. Oracle drivers and applications use these events to achieve very fast detection of failures, balancing of connection pools following failures, and balancing of connection pools again when the failed components are repaired. For example, when the service at an instance starts, the FAN event is used immediately to route work to that resource. When the service at an instance or node fails, the FAN event is used immediately to interrupt applications to recover.</p>
                        <p>To solve high availability problems with database connections, Oracle Clusterware and Data Guard Broker post a FAN event, and also executes server-side callouts, immediately when a service changes state. A FAN event payload contains the relevant information that describes the status of the service on Oracle RAC. On receipt of the FAN event, applications can terminate sessions in communication with the failed instance or node, notify sessions waiting to resume operation, and reorganize in coming work when additional resources are available. To know which sessions to process, every session using Oracle Database has a unique connection signature. The session signatures match the FAN payload.</p>
                        <p>For planned outages, use any connection pool with FAN configured: OCI, UCP, ICC, WebLogic Server Active Grid Link, or ODP.Net. In addition to using FAN with connection pools, for the thin Java driver, beginning with Oracle Database 12<span class="italic">c</span> Release 2, FAN is automatically enabled by placing the ons.jar and simpleFAN.jar files on the <code class="codeph">CLASSPATH</code>, and by using the recommended TNS format.
                        </p>
                        <p>The FAN planned event drains the work at request boundaries. The customer's code can then retry for a new connection thereby avoiding outages with planned maintenance even without using a pool. Immediately, the FAN event is received for a planned down, the idle connections are removed from the pool for that service or instance, and the active (borrowed) connections are marked for release when they are returned to the pool. This effectively drains the work for planned outages with no interruption to the users. For the thin Java driver, connections are closed when your code checks the connection status after a FAN down event was received. See My Oracle Support Document 1593712.1 for the steps required to gracefully perform planned maintenance operations without application interruption.</p>
                        <p>FAN is also used for posting advisories for runtime connection load balancing, Web Affinity, and Data Dependent Routing.</p>
                        <p>In Oracle Database 12<span class="italic">c</span> Release 2 (12.2), Java containers, frameworks, and applications can use new APIs to subscribe to Oracle Database RAC FAN events for building high availability solutions They can receive FAN events (high availability and load balancing advisories) through the JDBC driver .without the need for a UCP

                        <div>
                           <p>Oracle integrated FAN with many of the common client application environments that are used to connect to Oracle RAC databases. The easiest way to use FAN is to use an integrated Oracle client. Oracle Database 12<span class="italic">c</span> Release 2 client drivers are FAN-aware, and FAN is enabled by default. This includes the JDBC Thin driver and Oracle Data Provider for Net (ODP.NET) drivers.
                           </p>
                           <p>Due to the integration with FAN, Oracle integrated clients are more aware of the current status of an Oracle RAC cluster. This prevents client connections from waiting or trying to connect to instances or services that are no longer available. When instances start, Oracle RAC uses FAN to notify the connection pool so that the connection pool can create connections to the recently started instance and take advantage of the additional resources that this instance provides.</p>
                           <p>Oracle client drivers that are integrated with FAN can:</p>
                           <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

                                 <p>Remove terminated connections immediately when a service is declared as DOWN at an instance, and immediately when nodes are declared as DOWN</p>
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                 <p>Report errors to clients immediately when Oracle Database detects the NOT RESTARTING state, instead of making the client wait while the service repeatedly attempts to restart</p>
                              </li>
                           </ul>

                                 <p>Balance connections across all of the Oracle RAC instances when a service starts; this is preferable to directing the sessions that are defined for the connection pool to the first Oracle RAC instance that supports the service</p>

                        <p>Transaction Guard is a generic tool for applications to provide a reliable, known outcome for transactions following planned and unplanned outages. Applications use a new concept called the logical transaction ID to determine the outcome of the last transaction open in a database session following an outage. Without using Transaction Guard, applications that attempt to retry operations following outages can cause logical corruption by committing duplicate transactions.</p>
                        <p>Failing to recognize that the last submission has committed, will commit sometime soon, or has not run to completion can lead applications that attempt to replay to cause duplicate transaction submissions and other forms of logical corruption because the software might try to re-issue already persisted changes.</p>
                        <p>Without Transaction Guard, if a transaction was started and a commit was issued, the commit message that is sent back to the client is not durable. The client is left not knowing whether the transaction committed or not. The transaction cannot be validly resubmitted if the non-transactional state is incorrect or if it is already committed. In the absence of guaranteed commit and completion information, resubmission can lead to transactions applied more than once and in the incorrect state.</p>
                        <p>Starting with Oracle Database 12<span class="italic">c</span> Release 2, Transaction Guard supports XA optimizations. Transaction Guard supports local transactions and XA transactions that use <code class="codeph">TMONEPHASE</code> during the commit operation. When the application issues an XA transaction that uses <code class="codeph">TMTWOPHASE</code>, the Transaction Guard disables itself for that transaction and automatically re-enables to prepare itself for the next transaction. This allows Transaction Guard to support the following XA transactions:

                        <p>A highly available architecture requires the ability of the application tier to transparently fail over to a surviving instance or database advertising the required service. This ensures that applications are generally available or minimally impacted in the event of all recoverable failures including database sessions, nodes, instances, networks, data corruption, and read and write time outs. Application Continuity masks hardware, software, network, storage errors, and time outs in a high availability environment running either Oracle RAC, Oracle RAC One, or Active Data Guard for instance or site failover. Application Continuity attempts to mask recoverable outages by replaying the request at another available Oracle RAC instance or to another database (such as in the case of a Data Guard role transition). </p>

                        <p>Masking outages of the database session is a complex task for application development and, as a result, errors and time outs are often exposed to the users. Application Continuity attempts to mask outages from users and applications by recovering the database session following recoverable outages, unplanned and planned. Application Continuity performs this recovery beneath the application so that the outage appears to the application as a delayed execution. For the recovery to succeed, the data and messages restored to the client by Application Continuity must be the same as those that the application has seen and potentially made decisions on.</p>
                        <p>Application Continuity is started for outages that are recoverable, typically related to underlying software, foreground, hardware, communications, network, or storage layers. Application Continuity is used to improve the user experience when handling both unplanned outages and planned outages.</p>
                        <p>Application Continuity is available for applications using Java, OCI, and ODP.NET, Unmanaged Driver</p>

                  <div>
                     <p>Global Data Services enables administrators to automatically and transparently manage client workloads across replicated databases that offer common services. A database service is a named representation of one or more database instances. Services enable you to group database workloads and route a particular work request to an appropriate instance. A global service is a service provided by multiple databases synchronized through data replication.</p>
                     <p>Global Data Services provides dynamic load balancing, failover, and centralized service management for a set of replicated databases that offer common services. The set of databases can include Oracle RAC and noncluster Oracle databases interrelated through Oracle Data Guard, databases consolidated under Oracle Multitenant, Oracle GoldenGate, or any other replication technology.</p>
                     <p>The benefits of Global Data Services include the following:</p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>
                           <p>Enables you to centrally manage global resources, including globally distributed multiple database configurations</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Provides global scalability, availability, and runtime load balancing</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Supports seamless failover</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Enables you to dynamically add databases to the GDS configuration and dynamically migrate global services</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Enables optimal resource utilization</p>
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>The global services management framework is the software infrastructure for global services. This framework automates and centralizes configuration, maintenance, and monitoring of a GDS configuration, and enables load balancing and failover for services. The framework manages these virtualized resources with minimal administrative overhead, enabling the configuration to handle additional client requests.</p>
                     <p>The global services management framework is built around the following preexisting Oracle Database technologies:</p>

               </h3>
               <div>
                  <p>Oracle Multitenant is the optimal database consolidation method from Oracle Database 12<span class="italic">c</span> onward. The multitenant architecture combines the best attributes of each of the previous consolidation methods without their accompanying tradeoffs.
                  </p>
                  <p>Oracle Multitenant helps reduce IT costs by simplifying consolidation, provisioning, upgrades and more. This new architecture allows a container database (CDB) to hold many pluggable databases (PDBs). To applications, these PDBs appear as a standalone database, and no changes are required to the application in order to access the PDB. By consolidating multiple databases as PDBs into a single CDB, you are provided with the ability to manage "many as one". The flexibility remains to operate on PDBs in isolation should your business require it.</p>
                  <p>Oracle Multitenant is fully compliant with and takes direct advantage of high availability features such as Oracle Real Application Clusters, Oracle Data Guard, and Oracle GoldenGate, just like any non-container database (non-CDB), meaning it can be used in any of the Oracle MAA reference architectures. Grouping multiple PDBs with the same high availability requirements into the same CDB ensures that all of those PDBs and their applications are managed and protected with the same technologies and configurations.</p>

                        <li>
                           <p>High consolidation density - Many PDBs can be stored in a single CDB. These PDBs share background processes and memory structures letting you run more PDBs than you would non-CDBs, because the overhead for each non-CDB is removed or reduced. In Oracle Database 12<span class="italic">c</span> Release 2 you can store up to 4095 PDBs in a CDB. Each PDB can also have a different characterset from other PDBs within the same CDB, as long as the CDB root character set is a superset of all of the PDBs’ character sets. Logical standby databases also support this mix of character sets to allow rolling upgrades with a transient logical standby database.

                           <p>Online provisioning operations, including clones, refreshable clones, and PDB relocation - A PDB can be unplugged from one CDB and plugged into another. A PDB can also be cloned either into the same CDB or into a different CDB. Cloning can be used to create a "gold image" or seed database for DBaaS or SaaS environments. This PDB can then be rapidly cloned to easily set up database environments for new customers. The following functionality is available as of Oracle Database 12<span class="italic">c</span> Release 2:
                           </p>

                                 <p>Near Zero Downtime PDB Relocation &#x2013; This feature significantly reduces the downtime of relocating a PDB from one CDB to another by using clone functionality. The source PDB remains open and functional while the relocation takes place. The application outage is reduced to a very short window while the source PDB is brought to a consistent state, and the destination PDB is synchronized and brought online. This functionality also takes advantage of another new feature, Listener Redirects, which allows you to keep the same connect descriptor for applications and connect to the destination PDB even after it has been relocated.</p>
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                 <p>Online provisioning and cloning  &#x2013; Clones of PDBs can be created without requiring the source PDB to be placed in read only-mode. The source PDB can be left in read-write mode and accessible to applications for the duration of the clone operation.</p>
                              </li>

                                 <p>Refreshable Clone PDB &#x2013; Clones of PDBs can be created in such a way as to be refreshed with changes with changes made to the source PDB applied either automatically at set intervals or manually. For a clone to be refreshable it must remain in read-only mode. The clone can be converted into an ordinary PDB by opening it read-write.  Refreshable clones are well suited to be used as test masters for Exadata storage snapshots.</p>

                        <li>
                           <p>New patching and upgrade options -When you upgrade or patch a CBD, all of the PDBs in that container are also upgraded or patched. If you need isolation, you can unplug a PDB and plug it into a CDB at a later version.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Database backup and recovery - By consolidating multiple databases as PDBs, operations such as backup and disaster recovery are performed at the container level. Oracle Multitenant also provides the flexibility to backup and restore individual PDBs with no impact to other running PDBs in the same CDB.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Operation with Oracle Data Guard - Data Guard configurations are maintained at the CDB level. When a Data Guard role transition (either failover or switchover) is performed, all PDBs are transitioned to the new primary database. There is no need to create or manage multiple Data Guard configurations for each PDB as would be required for single databases. Existing tools such as Data Guard Standby First Patching and Data Guard Transient Logical Rolling Upgrade can still be used to reduce downtime and are performed at the container level, so all PDBs will be maintained in a single operation. The following functionality has been added in Oracle Database 12<span class="italic">c</span> Release 2:

                                 <p>PDB Migration with Data Guard Broker &#x2013; The Data Guard broker has been enhanced to provide automation for migrating PDBs from one CDB, either the primary database or the standby database, to another CDB. This can be used for straight migration of a PDB from one CDB to another running at either at the same version or a CDB running at a higher version to start the upgrade process. This automation can also be used to affect a single PDB failover by using the PDBs files at a standby database to plug into a different CDB at the same version.</p>
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                 <p>Subset Standby  - A subset standby enables users of Oracle Multitenant to designate a subset of the PDBs in a CDB for replication to a standby database. This provides a finer granularity of designating which standby databases will contain which PDBs.</p>

GoldenGate also provides the flexibility to operate at the PDB level, allowing replication to occur for a subset of the PDBs in a CDB. GoldenGate can be used for minimal to zero downtime upgrades either at the CDB level or at an individual PDB level.</p>

This can ensure that a single PDB does not access more than its assigned share of system resources. In Oracle Database 12<span class="italic">c</span> Release 2 you have the ability to specify guaranteed minimums and maximums for SGA, buffer cache, shared pool, and PGA memory at the PDB limit.

Oracle Multitenant enables Flashback Database to be used on an individual PDB without impacting the availability of other PDBs. Flashback Database can performed at the CDB level which will flashback all of the PDBs in the container. Starting in Oracle Database 12<span class="italic">c</span> Release 2, individual PDBs can be flashed back using the Flashback Pluggable Database feature. When flashing back an individual PDB all other PDBs remain unaffected.

               </h3>
               <div>
                  <p>Oracle Sharding is a scalability and availability feature for custom-designed OLTP applications explicitly designed to run on a sharded database.</p>
                  <p>Oracle sharding enables distribution and replication of data across a pool of Oracle databases that share no hardware or software. The pool of databases is presented to the application as a single logical database. Applications elastically scale (data, transactions, and users) to any level, on any platform, simply by adding additional databases (shards) to the pool. Scaling up to 1000 shards is supported in the first release with Oracle Database 12<span class="italic">c</span> Release 2.
                  </p>
                  <p>Oracle Sharding provides superior run-time performance and simpler life-cycle management compared to home-grown deployments that use a similar approach to scalability. It also provides the advantages of an enterprise DBMS, including&nbsp; relational schema, SQL, and other programmatic interfaces, support for complex data types, online schema changes, multi-core scalability, advanced security, compression, high-availability, ACID properties, consistent reads, developer agility with JSON, and much more.</p>

               </h3>
               <div>
                  <p>Oracle Restart is a new feature in Oracle 11<span class="italic">g</span> Release 2 (11.2) that enhances the availability of a single-instance (nonclustered) Oracle database and its components. Oracle Restart is used in single-instance environments only. For Oracle Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC) environments, the functionality to automatically restart components is provided by Oracle Clusterware. 
                  </p>
                  <p>If you install Oracle Restart, it automatically restarts the database, the listener, and other Oracle components after a hardware or software failure or whenever the database's host computer restarts. It also ensures that the Oracle components are restarted in the proper order, in accordance with component dependencies.</p>
                  <p>Oracle Restart periodically monitors the health of components—such as SQL*Plus, the Listener Control utility (LSNRCTL), ASMCMD, and Oracle Data Guard—that are integrated with Oracle Restart. If the health check fails for a component, Oracle Restart shuts down and restarts the component.</p>
                  <p>Oracle Restart runs out of the Oracle Grid Infrastructure home, which you install separately from Oracle Database homes.</p>
                  <p>Integrated client failover applications depend on role based services and Fast Application Notification events, managed by Oracle clusterware, to alert the application to failures. Single instance databases must have Oracle Restart to achieve integrated client failover.</p>
