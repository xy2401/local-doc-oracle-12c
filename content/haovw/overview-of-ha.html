               </h3>
               <div>
                  <p><a id="d2630e286" class="indexterm-anchor"></a><a id="d2630e290" class="indexterm-anchor"></a><span class="bold">Availability</span> is the degree to which an application, service, or function is accessible on demand. Availability is measured by the perception of an application's user. Users experience frustration when their data is unavailable or the computing system is not performing as expected, and they do not understand or care to differentiate between the complex components of an overall solution. Performance failures due to higher than expected usage create the same disruption as the failure of critical components in the <a id="d2630e297" class="indexterm-anchor"></a>architecture. If a user cannot access the system, it is said to be <span class="bold">unavailable</span>. Generally, the term <span class="bold">downtime</span> is used to refer to periods when a system is unavailable.
                  </p>
                  <p>Users who want their systems to be always ready to serve them need <span class="bold">high availability</span>. A system that is highly available is designed to provide uninterrupted computing services during essential time periods, during most hours of the day, and most days of the week throughout the year; this measurement is often shown as <a id="d2630e313" class="indexterm-anchor"></a><a id="d2630e315" class="indexterm-anchor"></a><span class="bold">24x365</span>. Such systems may also need a high availability solution for planned maintenance operations such as upgrading a system's hardware or software.
                  </p>
                  <p><a id="d2630e323" class="indexterm-anchor"></a>Reliability, recoverability, timely error detection, and continuous operations are primary characteristics of a highly available solution:
                  </p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                     <li>
                        <p><span class="bold">Reliability</span>: Reliable hardware is one component of a high availability solution. Reliable software—including the database, web servers, and applications—is just as critical to implementing a highly available solution. A related characteristic is resilience. For example, low-cost commodity hardware, combined with software such as Oracle Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC), can be used to implement a very reliable system. The <span class="italic">resilience</span> of an Oracle RAC database allows processing to continue even though individual servers may fail.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p><span class="bold">Recoverability</span>: There may be many ways to recover from a failure. Therefore, it is important to determine what types of failures may occur in your high availability environment and how to recover from those failures quickly in order to meet your business requirements. For example, if a critical table is accidentally deleted from the database, what action should you take to recover it? Does your <a id="d2630e342" class="indexterm-anchor"></a>architecture provide the ability to recover in the time specified in a service-level agreement (SLA)? 
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p><span class="bold">Timely error detection</span>: If a component in your architecture fails, then fast detection is essential to recover from the unexpected failure. Although you may be able to recover quickly from an outage, if it takes an additional 90 minutes to discover the problem, then you may not meet your SLA. Monitoring the health of your environment requires reliable software to view it quickly and the ability to notify the database administrator of a problem.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p><span class="bold">Continuous operation</span>: Providing continuous access to your data is essential when very little or no downtime is acceptable to perform maintenance activities. Activities, such as moving a table to another location in the database or even adding CPUs to your hardware, should be transparent to the user in a high availability architecture. 
                        </p>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>More specifically, a high availability architecture should have the<a id="d2630e359" class="indexterm-anchor"></a> following traits:
                  </p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                     <li>
                        <p>Tolerate failures such that processing continues with minimal or no interruption</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Be transparent to—or tolerant of—system, data, or application changes</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Provide built-in preventive measures</p>

                     <li>

               </h3>
               <div>
                  <p>The <a id="d2630e503" class="indexterm-anchor"></a>importance of high availability varies among applications. Databases and the Internet have enabled worldwide collaboration and information sharing by extending the reach of database applications throughout organizations and communities. This reach emphasizes the importance of high availability in data management solutions. Both small businesses and global enterprises have users all over the world who require access to data 24 hours a day. Without this data access, operations can stop, and revenue is lost. Users now demand service-level agreements from their information technology (IT) departments and solution providers, reflecting the increasing dependence on these solutions. Increasingly, availability is measured in dollars, euros, and yen, not just in time and convenience. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Enterprises have used their IT infrastructure to provide a competitive advantage, increase productivity, and empower users to make faster and more informed decisions. However, with these benefits has come an increasing dependence on that infrastructure. If a critical application becomes unavailable, then the business can be in jeopardy. The business might lose revenue, incur penalties, and receive bad publicity that has a lasting effect on customers and on the company's stock price. </p>
                  <p>It is important to examine the <a id="d2630e512" class="indexterm-anchor"></a><a id="d2630e516" class="indexterm-anchor"></a>factors that determine how your data is protected and maximize availability to your users.
                  </p>
               </div>
            </div><a id="HAOVW11819"></a><div class="props_rev_3"><a id="GUID-1FEB3310-22FB-4B63-88FC-BAC6153AB8CD" name="GUID-1FEB3310-22FB-4B63-88FC-BAC6153AB8CD"></a><h3 id="HAOVW-GUID-1FEB3310-22FB-4B63-88FC-BAC6153AB8CD" class="sect3"><span class="enumeration_section">1.3 </span>Cost of Downtime
               </h3>
               <div>
                  <p>The need to deliver increasing levels of availability continues to accelerate as enterprises reengineer their solutions to gain competitive advantage. Most often, these new solutions rely on immediate access to critical business data. When data is not available, the operation can cease to function. Downtime can lead to lost productivity, lost revenue, damaged customer relationships, bad publicity, and lawsuits. </p>
                  <p>It is not always easy to place a direct cost on downtime. Angry customers, idle employees, and bad publicity are all costly, but not directly measured in currency. On the other hand, lost revenue and legal penalties incurred because SLA objectives are not met can easily be quantified. The cost of downtime can quickly grow in industries that are dependent on their solutions to provide service. </p>
                  <p>Other <a id="d2630e641" class="indexterm-anchor"></a><a id="d2630e645" class="indexterm-anchor"></a>factors to consider in the cost of downtime are: 
                  </p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                     <li>
                        <p>The maximum tolerable length of a single unplanned outage</p>
                        <p>If the event lasts less than 30 seconds, then it may cause very little impact and may be barely perceptible to users. As the length of the outage grows, the effect may grow exponentially and negatively affect the business.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>The maximum frequency of allowable incidents</p>
                        <p>Frequent outages, even if short in duration, may similarly disrupt business operations. </p>

                  <p>When designing a solution, it is important to recognize the true cost of downtime to understand how the business can benefit from availability improvements.</p>
                  <p>Oracle provides a range of high availability solutions to fit every organization regardless of size. Small workgroups and global enterprises alike are able to extend the reach of their critical business applications. With Oracle and the Internet, applications and data are reliably accessible everywhere, at any time.</p>

               <div>
                  <p>One of the challenges in designing a high availability solution is examining and addressing all of the possible causes of downtime. It is important to consider causes of both unplanned and planned downtime when designing a fault-tolerant and resilient IT infrastructure. Planned downtime can be just as disruptive to operations as unplanned downtime, especially in global enterprises that support users in multiple time zones.</p>

In this case, the write I/O from one node is not immediately visible to another node because it is cached.
