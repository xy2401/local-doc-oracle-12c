            <p>The screenshot shows the Service Properties section of the Create Service page. The first option shown is the Failover Type option which is followed by an action list that shows the value None. If you choose to specify a Failover Type, in the next line you can specify the Failover Delay by entering the number of milliseconds in a text entry box. You can also specify the number of Failover Retries in a text entry box. Next is the option Enable Distributed Transaction Processing, which is not selected in the screenshot. This option is following by the text "Choose this option for all Distributedtransactions, including XA, JTA.Services with exactly one preferred instance can enable this."</p>
            <p>Next the Connection Load Balancing Goal options are listed. The first option is Short, which is currently selected. The second option is Long, which is not selected. Below the Connection Load Balancing Goal options is the text "Load balance connections based on elapsed time (Short) or number of sessions (Long)."  Below the descriptive text is the Edition drop-down list, which currently shows a value of None.</p>
            <p>In the middle of the screenshot are two sections. The section on the left is titled Notification Properties, and it has two items. The first is a check box labeled Enable Load Balancing Advisory, and it is not checked. For the Load Balancing Advisory, there are two options, of which you can select one. The first option, Service Time, is selected. The other option is Throughput. Below these two options is the descriptive text "Enable advisory for load balancing based on service quality". Below this text is the second item, Enable Fast Application Notification (FAN) for OCI and ODP.NET Applications, which is not selected.</p>
            <p>To the right of the Notification Properties section is the Service Threshold Levels section. The text for this section reads "If thresholds are specified, alerts will be published when the service elapsed response time and/or CPU time exceed the threshold." Below this text are two rows. Each row has two text entry fields labeled Warning and Critical. The first row has the heading Elapsed Time Threshold (milliseconds). The second row has the heading CPU Time Threshold (milliseconds). There are no values specified in the text entry fields in either row.</p>
            <p>Near the bottom of the screenshot is the section titled Resource Management Properties. The text for this section says "Associate this service with a predefined consumer group or job class." There are two action lists in this section. The first is labeled Consumer Group Mapping, and it has the value None selected. The second list is labeled Job Scheduler Mapping and it has the value None selected.</p>
