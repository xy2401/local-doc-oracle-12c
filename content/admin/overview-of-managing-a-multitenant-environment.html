                  <div>
                     <p>A CDB includes the root, the CDB seed, and PDBs.</p>
                     <p>A CDB includes the following components:</p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>
                           <p>Root</p>
                           <p>The root, named <code class="codeph">CDB$ROOT</code>, stores Oracle-supplied metadata and common users. An example of metadata is the source code for Oracle-supplied PL/SQL packages. A common user is a database user known in every container. A CDB has exactly one root.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>CDB seed</p>
                           <p>The CDB seed, named <code class="codeph">PDB$SEED</code>, is a template that you can use to create new PDBs. You cannot add objects to or modify objects in the CDB seed. A CDB has exactly one CDB seed.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>PDBs</p>
                           <p>A PDB appears to users and applications as if it were a non-CDB. For example, a PDB can contain the data and code required to support a specific application. A PDB is fully backward compatible with Oracle Database releases before Oracle Database 12<span class="italic">c</span>.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>Each of these components is called a container. Therefore, the root is a container, the CDB seed is a container, and each PDB is a container. Each container has a unique container ID and name within a CDB. <a href="overview-of-managing-a-multitenant-environment.html#GUID-C370D6F4-0AD6-48B6-B3A2-74DC8BB31909__BHCBFHED">Figure 36-1</a> shows a CDB with several PDBs.

                     <p>You can easily plug a PDB into a CDB and unplug a PDB from a CDB. When you plug in a PDB, you associate the PDB with a CDB. When you unplug a PDB, you disassociate the PDB from a CDB. An unplugged PDB consists of an XML file that describes the PDB and the PDB's files (such as the data files and wallet file).</p>
                     <p>You can unplug a PDB from one CDB and plug it into a different CDB without altering your schemas or applications. A PDB can be plugged into only one CDB at a time.</p>
                     <p>Each PDB has a globally unique identifier (GUID). The PDB GUID is primarily used to generate names for directories that store the PDB's files, including both Oracle Managed Files directories and non-Oracle Managed Files directories.</p>

                     <p>A common user can log in to the root and any container in which it has been granted <code class="codeph">CREATE SESSION</code> privilege. The operations that a common user can perform depend on the privileges granted to the common user. Some administrative tasks, such as creating a PDB or unplugging a PDB, must be performed by a common user. A CDB also supports local users. A local user is a user that exists in exactly one PDB.

                     <p>Some database administrators manage an entire CDB, while others manage individual PDBs.</p>
                     <p>The database administrators who manage an entire CDB connect to the CDB as common users, and they manage attributes of the entire CDB and the root, as well as some attributes of PDBs. For example, these database administrators can create, unplug, plug in, and drop PDBs. They can also specify the temporary tablespace and the default tablespace for the root, and they can change the open mode of one or more PDBs.</p>
                     <p>Database administrators can also connect to a specific PDB as a local PDB administrator and then perform a subset of management tasks on the PDB that a database administrator performs on a non-CDB. The subset of tasks are those required for the PDB to support an application. For example, these can include management of tablespaces and schemas in a PDB, specification of storage parameters for that PDB, changing the open mode of the current PDB, and setting PDB-level initialization parameters.</p>

                     <p> </p>
                     <p>An application container is a special type of PDB that has an application root that is separate from the root in its CDB, and it can have one or more PDBs. When a PDB belongs to an application root, it is referred to as an application PDB.</p>
                     <p>An application root is a container to which application PDBs can belong. An application root belongs to its CDB root and shares descriptions of Oracle-supplied common objects in the CDB root. In addition, an application root enables you to create application common objects that are shared only by the application root and the application PDBs that belong to the application root. Application common objects are not visible to the CDB root, other application roots, or PDBs that do not belong to the application root. An application root cannot belong to another application root, and a PDB can belong to either no application roots or to only one application root.</p>
                     <p>You can create an application seed for an application container. The application seed is optional, but, if it exists, you can use it to create application PDBs quickly that match the requirements of the application container. An application seed enables instant provisioning of application PDBs that are created from it.</p>

                     <p>You can specify one or more application names for each application container, and each application name has an application version. For an application PDB that is not currently part of the application container, the names and versions of its applications determine whether it can be cloned to, plugged in to, or relocated to the application root. If an application container does not have an application name or application version specified, then only PDBs that also do not have them specified can be plugged into the application container.</p>
                     <p>You can install an application in the application root. The installation can be script-driven or GUI driven, or a combination of the two. To use this method to install an application, run the <code class="codeph">ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE APPLICATION BEGIN INSTALL</code> SQL statement before installing the application and the <code class="codeph">ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE APPLICATION END INSTALL</code> SQL statement after installing the application. After the application is installed in the application root, you can install the application in application PDBs by synchronizing them.
                     </p>
                     <p>Each application container can have its own application common users, application roles, and application profiles, which can be created only when the current container is the application root. Application common users can connect or switch only to the application root in which they were created and to application PDBs that belong to the application root.</p>

               </h3>
               <div>
                  <p>A multitenant environment enables the central management of multiple PDBs in a single installation and enables you to accomplish several goals.</p>
                  <p>By using a multitenant environment, you can accomplish the following goals:</p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                     <li>
                        <p>Cost reduction</p>
                        <p>By consolidating hardware and database infrastructure to a single set of background processes, and efficiently sharing computational and memory resources, you reduce costs for hardware and maintenance.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Easier and more rapid movement of data and code</p>
                        <p>By design, you can plug a PDB into a CDB, unplug the PDB from the CDB, and then plug this PDB into a different CDB. Therefore, you can easily move an application's database back end from one server to another.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Easier management and monitoring of the physical database</p>
                        <p>The CDB administrator can manage the environment as an aggregate by executing a single operation, such as patching or performing an RMAN backup, for all hosted tenants and the CDB root.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Separation of data and code</p>
                        <p>Although consolidated into a single physical CDB, PDBs mimic the behavior of traditional non-CDBs. For example, a PDB administrator can flush the shared pool or buffer cache in the context of a PDB without affecting other PDBs in the CDB.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Ease of performance tuning</p>
                        <p>It is easier to collect performance metrics for a CDB than for multiple non-CDBs. It is easier to size one SGA than several SGAs.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Support for Oracle Database Resource Manager</p>
                        <p>In any shared resource environment, administrators must manage system resources to provide a predictable environment for users and address unexpected or transient resource contention. To address these issues and to provide resource usage monitoring, you can use Oracle Database Resource Manager (see <a href="using-oracle-resource-manager-for-pdbs-with-sql-plus.html#GUID-2708E76D-E18B-4586-920A-BD4B904AE14D" title="You can use PL/SQL package procedures to administer Oracle Resource Manager (Resource Manager) to allocate resources to pluggable databases (PDBs) in a multitenant container database (CDB)."> Using Oracle Resource Manager for PDBs with SQL*Plus</a>).
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Fewer patches and upgrades</p>
                        <p>It is easier to apply a patch to one CDB than to multiple non-CDBs and to upgrade one CDB than to upgrade several non-CDBs.</p>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>A multitenant environment is especially useful when you have many non-CDBs deployed on different hardware in multiple Oracle Database installations. These non-CDBs might use only a fraction of the hardware resources dedicated to them, and each one might not require a full-time database administrator to manage it.</p>
                  <p>By combining these non-CDBs into a CDB, you can make better use of your hardware resources and database administrator resources. In addition, you can move a PDB from one CDB to another without requiring changes to the applications that depend on the PDB.</p>
